# Tree_CoverType
Project that helps predict the cover type of Trees in the Wilderness: America
You are going to use a variant of the Cover Type dataset. This can be used to train a model that predicts the forest cover type based on cartographic variables. You can read more about the original dataset here

the qualitative data has already been one-hot encoded (e.g. Soil_Type has 40 binary columns where a 1 indicates presence of a feature). We will use a modified version of this dataset that shows a more raw format. This will let you practice your skills in handling different data types. 

You can see the code for preparing the dataset here
